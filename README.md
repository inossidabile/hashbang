# Bang. Hashbang.

Hashbang will automatically enable serving HTML dumps for your AJAX web-applications according to 
[Google conventions](http://code.google.com/web/ajaxcrawling/). Make your Rails AJAX applications indexable in no time.

Hashbang will make all incoming requests containing magic `_escaped_fragment_` parameter to be served in a special way. This case will cause a subrequest to a real AJAX URL using virtual browser. This hidden browser will wait for some condition you define using well-known [Watir](http://watirwebdriver.com/) API. And then return an HTML dump.

Let's say for example you've got a request to `test.com/?_escaped_fragment_=/my_hidden_page`.

Hashbang will convert this URL to `test.com/#!/my_hidden_page` and open it in a virtual browser.

Virtual browser will call your lambda with `browser` object as parameter. With help of this lambda you can setup the wait behavior. Here is a great introduction to [Watir wait API](http://watirwebdriver.com/waiting/). Note that your lambda will act as a block to `Watir::Wait.until`.

## Installation & Example

Start from your Gemfile:

```
  gem 'hashbang'
```
  
Waiter can be defined inside your environments:

```ruby
  config.hashbang.waiter = -> b { b.execute_script("return Joosy.Application.loading") == false }
```

This code will wait for javascript Joosy.Application.loading variable to be set to false.

## Development environment

By its nature Hashbang gem requires your server to accept at least 2 concurrent connections. However WEBRick or Thin (which are mostly used as development server) will only serve one connection. That's why if you want to debug your AJAX crawling, you'll have to use `unicorn` with at least 2 workers.
